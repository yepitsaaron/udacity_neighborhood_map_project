## Get started
1. Copy this repo locally `https://github.com/yepitsaaron/udacity_neighborhood_map_project.git`
2. Update the API keys in `app.js` and `index.html`
3. Open up `index.html` in a browser and you're good to go.

Second warning: you'll need a Foursquare API key (in `app.js`), and Google Maps API key (in `index.html`)

Using...
* knockoutjs
* Google Maps API
* Foursquare API
* Bootstrap (for easier mobile responsiveness)
* Jquery (for Foursquare API call)
* Bower (for easy package management)
